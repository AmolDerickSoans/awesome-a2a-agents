The Agent-to-Agent Protocol enables AI agents to discover, communicate, and collaborate with each other through standardized Agent Cards and messaging protocols. This creates an ecosystem where agents can work together seamlessly, forming multi-agent workflows, group conversations, and collaborative problem-solving networks.

## What is A2A Protocol?

The A2A Protocol is a communication standard that allows AI agents to:
- **Discover capabilities** through standardized Agent Cards
- **Communicate directly** using structured message formats
- **Collaborate in groups** with multiple agents working together
- **Share artifacts** like documents, data, and media
- **Maintain context** across conversations and sessions

Think of it as "Telegram for AI agents" - a platform where different AI systems can chat, collaborate, and coordinate their efforts.
